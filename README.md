# Restaurant Review - Stage 1
---
Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.


## How to run the app

1. Clone or download the repo from https://github.com/windflykida/Project-6-Restaurant-stage-1 


2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`. You will visit a restaurant page that will also work offline (you can check it out with Chrome DevTools -> Network-> Offline or Chrome DevTools -> Application -> Service Worker).
